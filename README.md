# alap

### Any link, all places. Enhance links with multiple targets.
____
## Overview

Alap enables attaching menus to links.

The traditional approach with an HTML anchor has been "each anchor, one target". Alap gives a flexible way to turn that into "each anchor, many targets". It can be used in a very simple mode ("I want this item, another item, and another, and that's it").  It also lets you build up menu items in more powerful ways (treating tags like CSS Classes, using expressions to group or exclude items, and more).
