# alap

### Any link, all places. Enhance links with multiple targets.
____
## Overview

Alap enables attaching menus to links.

The traditional approach with an HTML anchor has been "each anchor, one target". Alap gives a flexible way to turn that into "each anchor, many targets". It can be used in a very simple mode ("I want this item, another item, and another, and that's it").

Alap also lets you build up menu items in more powerful ways (treating tags like CSS Classes, using expressions to group or exclude items, and more).


## Installation

```sh
npm i alap
```

In your `index.html`:

```html
  <script defer src="example.js"></script>
```

and then in your `example.js`, import your config object, alap, and initialize:

```js
import { alapConfig } from "./Config.js";

// our lib, locally...
import Alap from "../src/index.js";

// ...or, if you are using npm, this would be:
// import Alap from "alap";

// pass the config object
const alap = new Alap(alapConfig);
```

## Demo

There is an example within the package itself:
```sh
% cd examples/overview
% parcel serve index.html   --no-cache
Server running at http://localhost:1234 
âœ¨  Built in 1.94s.
```

## Configuration

Configuration is done in two places:

* data for all elements, via a JavaScript object.
* per-anchor config in the `data-alap-linkitems` attribute

See `examples/overview/Config.js` for a fully fleshed out example object.

### Config Object

Here is a small sample:

```js
export const alapConfig = {
  settings: {
    listType: "ul",
    menuTimeout: 5000,
  },

  allLinks: {
    bmwe36: {
      label: "BMW (E36) - Wikipedia",
      url: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3_Series_(E36)",
      tags: ["e36m3", "bmw", "car", "germany"],
    },

    another_item: {
      label: "Another Item",
      url: "https://example.org",
      tags: [
        "photography",
        "techreview",
        "youtube"
      ],
    }
  }
};
```

### The `settings` property

|  Setting | Values |
------| -----
listType | can be `ul` or `ol` for unordered, or ordered lists
menuTimeout | if you mouse away from the menu, time in milliseconds before menu dismisses itself. Example: 5000 would dismiss after 5 seconds


_Note: menu will also dismiss itself if you click outside of it, or hit the ESCape key_


### The `allLinks` property

Most of the configuration resides in this nested object. Each entry 
represents a possible menu list item.

Sample Entry:

```js
a_menu_item: {
  label: "Some Item",
  url: "https://example.org",
  tags: ["photography", "techreview", "youtube"]
}
```

The ID for a menu item (such as "a_menu_item") must be unique.

|  Setting | Values |
------| -----
label | the label that appears in the menu list item
url | the target URL to go to when clicked on. The default is to open it up in another tab.
tags | an array of strings. These can be referred to from the `data-alap-linkitems` like a CSS Class.  Example: in the data attribute, ".photography" would match all entries that have a tag of "photography"


### HTML Anchor Configuration

Wherever you want to use alap on a page, you need to configure the anchor element. This is so that a) alap will recognize it (`class="alap"`) and b) alap will know what to look up (the `data-alap-linkitems` attribute)

Give each anchor a unique id. Alap has some optional functionality where you can grab definitions from anchors elsewhere on the page, by referring to their ID (yes, really!)

Sample:

```html
<a id="nyctag1" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems=".nyc"</a> 
```

### Referring to list item IDs

```html
<a id="my_nice_menu" class="alap"
  data-alap-linkitems="item1, item2, item3"</a> 
```

This would look for these entries in the Config Object: item1, item2, and item3

It is the simplest case. You're looking for specific items.
### Referring to tags by using a class specifier

```html
<a id="my_nice_menu" class="alap"
  data-alap-linkitems=".bridge, .city"</a> 
```
This can be thought of much like a CSS Class (looking through all items, and finding matches for a certain class)

This would look for entries in the Config Object that have tags that match. In our example, we're looking for all entries that have a tag of "bridge" or "city".

### Referring to DOM IDs elsewhere
```html
<a id="my_other_menu" class="alap"
  data-alap-linkitems="#my_nice_menu"</a> 
```

Think of the "#" here as an ID specifier.

We're not defining a new search for items with this, we're grabbing them from some place else.

If I point at `#my_nice_menu`, and `my_nice_menu` has ".bridge, .city" defined, then that's what I will get here as well.

You can combine these, such as `#my_favorite_cars, #fave_cities, #fave_airports` to build up a menu - all taken from definitions elsewhere on the page.

### Reserved for future use

Along with bare words, '.', and '#', the '@' symbol will be used in the future.  The intended functionality is to refer a Macro.  A Macro will be like defining `data-alap-linkitems`, except it will be in the JSON Config object. It will also provide the ability to override settings for the anchors where it used.

"image" is reserved for future use in an item object.
### Combining things

As you may have guessed, you can combine different types of specifiers, in order to build up a menu item list:

```html
I like <a id="combo_example" class="alap"
  data-alap-linkitems="bmwe36, vwbug, #beer1, .youtube">a lot of things</a>
```

You can use DOM IDs ('#'), tags ('.'), and specfic list item IDs.

### Expressions

Within the `data-alap-linkitems` attribute, you can use simple expressions to build up a list, and filter items out. We can use list item IDs and tags, along with AND, OR, and WITHOUT.
### Expressions: AND

The '+' operator means we want to match something in TWO places.  Here is a sample from the demo:

```html
<a id="nycandbridge" class="alap"
  data-alap-linkitems=".nyc + .bridge">"nyc AND bridge (+)"</a>
```

It means: find items that have the tag of "nyc" AND the tag of "bridge"
### Expressions: OR

The '|' operator means we want to match something in EITHER place.  Here is a sample from the demo:

```html
<a id="nycorbridge" class="alap"
  data-alap-linkitems=".nyc | .bridge">"nyc OR bridge (|)"</a>
```

It means: find items that have the tag of "nyc" OR the tag of "bridge"
### Expressions: WITHOUT

The '-' operator means we want to EXCLUDE items that match something.  Here is a sample from the demo:

```html
<a id="nycwobridge" class="alap"
  data-alap-linkitems=".nyc - .bridge">"nyc WITHOUT bridge (-)"</a>
```

It means: find items that have the tag of "nyc", and toss the items that match the tag of "bridge"

### Expressions: More Possibilities

You can chain together a more complex expression:

```html
<a id="nycorbridgenolon" class="alap"
  data-alap-linkitems=".nyc | .bridge - .london">nyc OR bridge, without London (| and -)</a>
```

It means: I want items that match the tag of "nyc" or "bridge", but toss out anything that includes the tag of "london".

Trying to use #DOM_IDs in an expression will fail at this time. It is a known bug.

## History, and the alap name

Alap is a plain vanilla JS rewrite of my 2012 MultiLinks package. That was done in jQuery.

I pondered using MultiLink, ManyLinks, or MenuLinks.  The names are pretty much taken, and there is always the question of singular vs plural (link? links?).

Alap keeps it simple, and you can think of it as whatever acronym that seems memorable to you (such as "a link, all places").  There is also a tie-in to music:

> The Alap is the opening section of a typical North Indian classical performance. It is a form of melodic improvisation that introduces and develops a raga.

This fits the spirit :)  Alap is a means of dynamically creating a menu (especially if we think of run-time bits of JSON), which introduce other web pages.
